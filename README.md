# MAST5112 part 2

# I have fixed all the bellow and the app now running very smooth without any bugs
Comment from the leture: The feature is implemented with some bugs(Adding menu Items).The feature is well-implemented with only one or two bugs(displaying). selecting from the menu does work with some bugs though. The feature is implemented but there are lots of bugs.
